Circumcircle - The circle that has all three points of a triangle on its perimiter.
Steiner Points - Points added to triangulation set to improve quality
Delauny Triangulation - if none of the points in a triangulation are inside
the circumcircle of any triangle in the triangulation.
Delauny Refinement - Given a PSLG (set of vertices and non-intersecting edges), insert steiner points until minimum angle is achieved.


Homotopy - A path that is "similar" to another path. Avoids the same obstacles.
Homotopy class - All the paths that are "similar".
